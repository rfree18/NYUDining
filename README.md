# NYUDining
## NOTE: No longer available
Please note that this app is no longer available for download from the App Store. I've graduated from NYU and I simply don't have the time to support this anymore, especially since I need to manually update times whenever there is a change. Feel free to fork/submit a PR for this if you'd like! I will do my best to update this and make it available once again in the future, but I can't guarantee anything.

NYUDining for iPhone makes finding all of the dining halls on campus simple and easy. Never again will you need to dig through CampusDish to find dining hours, location, and other details! Simply download NYUDining and find everything in a matter of seconds. Check back soon for updates!

**Support**: To report any bugs, issues, or feedback, please use the issues page and add a new issue. You can also email me directly at RFreemanApps@gmail.com and I will do my best to get back to you ASAP. Thanks :)

# Current Release Notes
Version 1.4.1 is all about offline! It fixes a crash that would affect some people when they had a weak internet connection. This release also includes offline support (beta), letting students view dining hall information even when NYU's wifi drops!

## Offline Mode (Beta)
Please note that offline support is a test feature and may not work consistently. In addition, information may not be up to date if it has not had a reliable internet connection in some time.

# Upcoming Release Notes (2.0)
Version 2.0 will be totally overhauled from the ground up. The entire app with be rethought to make the design more elegant and the features more powerful. It will also take advantage of new technologies from iOS 11. Stay tuned :)
**NOTE** Version 2.0 will be bumping up the minimum required version of iOS to 9.0.
