# Upcoming Release - Important Changes!
The upcoming 1.2.0 release is expected to bring the addition of menus for select dining halls. Menus will be displayed in an embeded web view within the app. All menus are updated and provided by NYU Dining Services.

# A Note about Parse
Parse, the service that hosts and provides the data for the NYUDining app, recently announced that they are beginning to wind down its services, taking the entire database offline early next year. In anticipation of this, I am currently in the process of setting up a new database and backend in the app, which is expected to be released with a future update. On the user side, this should not cause any significant change. However, this update ensures the security of the app's future and potentially allows for expanded functionality. 
# End of Support for Old Versions
Once the new backend is launched with the new backend implemented, I will begin to wind down the Parse database. Shortly after the update is released, all prior app versions will lose support and users will be forced to update to the latest release. This is being done to both allow for users to experience all of the enhanced features and to prevent users from experiencing a crashing app once Parse is taken offline. Users who have push notifications enabled will be given ample notification time.
